                    <h2>A* Search</h2>
                    <p>A* is an informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path between two points in a graph or
                        grid. It uses a heuristic function to evaluate nodes by combining the cost of reaching the node
                        (G
                        cost), with an estimate of the cost required to reach to end point (H cost) to give us the F
                        cost.
                        A* explores the most promising nodes first and guarantees optimal pathfinding.</p>

                    <h2>Breadth First Search</h2>
                    <p>Like A*, BFS guarantees the shortest path between two points by exploring all the nodes at the
                        current depth from the start point before moving on to the nodes at the next depth. BFS uses a queue
                        to keep track of nodes to be explored, which ensures that nodes are visited in the order they are
                        discovered. </p>

                    <h2>Depth First Search</h2>
                    <p>Unlike the previous two algorithms, DFS only guarantees a path between two points if it exists by
                        exploring as far as possible along along each path before backtracking. DFS uses a stack to keep
                        track of nodes to be explored which means it visits nodes in the order they were added to the stack.
                        Typically DFS explores unvisited nodes in the same order, but I added a randomizer to make the path
                        look more interesting.</p>

                    <h2>"Random Search"</h2>
                    <p>This algorithm is very similar to DFS, in which it guarantees a path between two points by using a stack to explore nodes. However, instead of the adding each node visited to the stack in the same order, it randomizes the order that the nodes are inserted. This produces a unique and chaotic exploration with each search.</p>
